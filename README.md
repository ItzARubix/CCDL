# CCDL

Welcome to the Celeste Classic Deathless List, shortened to CCDL. 

This Github page is where we're going to be keeping track of the hardest completed _deathless_ challenges in the game. 

A deathless challenge is one wherein a segment of gameplay is completed from start to finish without dying. This could be as short as a single room or as long as an entire full-length mod. This list is primarily run through this Git's Wiki, so click the Wiki button above to access all the information you need.
